/*
 * This file is part of the tutorial on how to use the TrotiNet library.
 *
 * Here, we show how to derive a transparent proxy from the base class
 * ProxyLogic which implements all the necessary logic related to the 
 * HTTP protocol.
 *
 * TransparentProxy is a proxy that does not change the semantics of
 * the communication, but simply logs requests and answers. The purpose
 * of this example is to show the two callbacks OnReceiveRequest()
 * and OnReceiveResponse(), which are called by the base class ProxyLogic.
